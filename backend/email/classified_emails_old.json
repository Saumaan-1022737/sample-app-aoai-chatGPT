Would this mean we need a completely new cabinet? Or could we have a sub-cabinet within CD01 that is only accessible by a select number of people? Or is there a different option?\nThank you,\nDaniela \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Hi Daniela,\nThere are two ways of going about this:\nCreate a new cabinet and only grant access to folks, who need itCreate a Sub Folder and make it only visible for certain role, like Engineers would see it, but Guests won\u2019t.\nOption 2 is ok, but if your main assembly contains objects from the hidden sub folder, users, who don\u2019t have access to it will still be able to modify the objects.\u00a0 We are testing Option 2 right now to see if we can restrict data viewing altogether, but are not quite there yet.\nThanks,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 9** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nI think we would prefer to go with option #1 and just make a new cabinet to avoid confusion.

And if there\u2019s any communication we need to do with our ODMs?\nThanks!\nBest regards,\nKevin \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n Hello Kevin,\nYes! We are preparing for an upgrade to Creo 10 to happen around the end of May.\nI\u2019m just curious: are you a part of Surface? Who is your ODM? We have a few teams that have expressed a desire to remain on Creo 7 to align with outside vendors, and some others that wish to go with Creo 9 for the same reason.\nWe will be communicating this upgrade broadly soon.\nHappy Monday!\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 3** \n\n Hi Craig,\nThanks for the quick response and information!\nI am part of the SCHIE group on the Azure Hardware side. The ODM that raised this question is Rittal but we also have other ODMs including Quanta, Wiwynn, Ingrasys, Lenovo, ZT\u2026etc. that we have not check with them yet.\nShould we start initiating this conversation with them? What would be our guidelines or options to them?\nThanks again!\nBest regards,\nKevin \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Thanks Kevin.\nThe Chie team seems to have a particularly challenging engagement with multiple vendors. Andy Regimbal (copied here for awareness) has been requesting to install Creo 9 for the same reason (aligning with Nvidia).\nWe should try to converge on a solution that will work across the Chie organization. I agree completely that aligning Creo versions with ODMs provides a big boost to productivity. This will be difficult with so many vendors.\nOur intent is to provide support for Creo 7, 9 and 10 simultaneously. I anticipate that this will lead to a new set of challenges. The only way we are aware of to manage this is to silo objects created using different versions of Creo in separate Windchill cabinets. Creo 10 will be capable of opening objects from any of these cabinets, but any older version will not.\nI hope this helps. Please consider this to be a work in progress.\nRegards,\nCraig \n\n\n",

    "email_content": "**email: 1** \n\n Hi PDMLink admins,\nBrian, Elliott, and I are trying to get access to the Denali cabinet (HK56) but are running into a tenting bug. Denali was originally in CPMT and it looks like that program has not made it over to CAMP. I think because the program is only a month away from public release they haven\u2019t bothered to add it to the CAMP tool. With CPMT out of commission we don\u2019t have a way to request tenting to get the Bot tool method to work.\nCould we please get some help getting read-only access to HK56? We\u2019re working on Detroit and read-only access to H56 will help for referencing previous work.\nThanks!\n-Nathan \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n Hello Nathan,\nDenali was renamed to GTD. I assume it would have been migrated to CAMP correctly. I suggest you reconfirm on the availability of this Project in CAMP.\nMeanwhile I will check with cabinet owners for your access request.\n@Ketan/@David/@Stephan/@Amit-Brian, Elliott, and Nathan are trying to get tented to HK56 program to get Guest access. Requesting any of you to approve their access request.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh. \n\n\n**email: 3** \n\n Ahhhhh thanks Priyanka. I\u2019m seeing GTD in the camp tool. Sorry for the confusion on the project name.\nThanks!\n-Nathan \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Hi All,\nLet me know when CAMP goes thru and I will approve for guest access to HK56.\nThanks,\nStephan \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hey team,\nI wanted to follow up and see if tenting went through and Nathan, Brian, and Elliot got the access they needed to HK56?\nBest Regards,\nDave Allaway \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hello David,\nThanks for checking, we haven\u2019t heard back from@Nathanon Tenting yet.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh. \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Appreciate the follow up! I was planning to try the bot tool once tenting goes through but it\u2019s stalling on the mechanical category for some reason at the moment. Brian is in the clear and has read only access. I\u2019ll keep an eye on tenting and try the bot tool but I\u2019ll reach out if this continues to be a delay.\nThank you all for looking out\ud83d\ude0a\n-Nathan \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Hi Priyanka, (removing some of the audience unless we need to keep people looped in)\nSorry to keep bugging you. Bot approval went through about 24 hours ago but I\u2019m still not seeing HK56 when I navigate to open products. I did a full device restart and also opened the assist tool and updated configs just in case.\nIs there a manual way to get access now that tenting and bot approval have gone through?\nHK56 not listed under common space products\nThanks!\n-Nathan \n\n\n**email: 9** \n\n Hello Nathan,\nRequest will be processed as soon as it is approved by any of the cabinet owner.\nThe request status still shows In Progress.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh. \n\n\n**email: 10** \n\n Thanks Priyanka!\nAdding@Amit Bhinde,@Stephan Cummings, and@David Allawayback\nHey all, would one of you please be able to approve read only cabinet access for Elliott and myself when you have a chance. Thank you!\nTenting is good to go:\nThanks!\n-Nathan \n\n\n**email: 11** \n\n Approved. \n\n\n**email: 12** \n\n Thank You Stephan.\n@Nathan\u2013 We have added you and Elliot to HK56 Guest role.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh. \n\n\n**email: 13** \n\n Thanks a bunch everyone! \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

If this intent I am assuming is correct, we should get you Lopez tenting which then gives you devices tenting as well. I suggest one of your director\u2019s will reach out on who needs this access in your org, instead of controlling the tenting one by one.\nCurrently Mineok Oh, Rui Jin, Brock Roland and Jay Gullapalli has requested access to Lopez one-by-one. I am not trying to be difficult, these tenting/confidentiality requirements are there in place for a reason.\nSami \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nCA06 Guest is linked to have guest access to CMR-Common, the way this is set up is to avoid complicate access management to this common folder.\nLuke and Zachary were approved to CA06 Guest on 3/27.\nBut when I checked CA06 guest list, their names are not there (could be they are added to one of the folder list?).\nCan you help to check where the issue is?\nThanks,\nLeo \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hi Leo,\nI don\u2019t think I ever responded to this.\u00a0 We were unaware of any linking of the CMR cabinet to the CA cabinets, so thank you for confirming this.\u00a0 We added Luke individually to the CA06 cabinet due to the nature of isolating access to anything else that Luke shouldn\u2019t see, if the group would be cross-linked, like three other folks in that cabinet.\nI will go ahead and add Luke to CA06-Guest group, which will resolve this altogether.\nThanks,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nI see where the misunderstanding is.\u00a0 When I responded to your request to add Luke Walker and Zachary Kisting to Guest access of CA06 email on 3/27 (attached), it meant adding the individuals to CA06-Guest group (not direct Guest role to CA06) as this is the organized way setup by Lucas for better access management to other folders like CMR-Common (shown below).\nI noticed the members are now individually added to CA06 groups, which is going to be difficult to manage in the future.\nAnd Luke and Terry are already in \u2018CA06-Guest\u2019 group, that means they are added twice.\nPlease make the following changes:\nRemove Luke from CA06 Members roleRemove Terry, Zachary, Keith from CA06 Guest roleAdd Zachary and Keith to \u2018CA06-Guest\u2019 group\nThanks,\nLeo \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Thank You Leo for looking into this and providing the solution.

    "email_content": "**email: 1** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nThanks for getting me set up with Windchill.\nA few questions/queries maybe you could help with:\nSay I have a part that is saved locally on my desktop or my OneDrive and I then save that file to my Windchill workspace. Is there then any link between that original file (on desktop or onedrive) and the one that lives in the Windchill workspace?\nUsually the users are working locally, and not in OneDrive.\u00a0 The local files and the checked in (commonspace) files do not have any connections, so you\u2019re safe with the local modifications, and should only check in what you want and are ready with. You can keep all your files in your Workspace in the Workgroup Manager.\nIs the \u2018correct\u2019 workflow for opening parts to do it through Windchill rather than file explorer or solidworks? Eg open my workspace, find the part, and click the \u2018Open in SolidWorks\u2019 icon?\nIf the parts are inside of our Windchill and you want to work on them, than yes, those [arts should be opened through Windchill, since that\u2019ll be your centralized repository.\u00a0 Locally created files (inside your SolidWorks session) will also be inside your Workspace, and be labelled as \u201cnewly created\u201d, which is that orange-ish circle or the \u201csun\u201d as I\u2019d like to call it\ud83d\ude0a.\u00a0 You can then check them into our Windchill as well, like we triedwith that one part earlier.\nWhen I open up the Documents > PTC Places > Workspace folder, it contains all the saved CAD files in the same place. Is the organisation of these parts into a folder structure something that I would do or would you guys need to create the folders for us?\nWe can give you the power to create folders in your domain (Products) or we can manage that stuff for you, so you don\u2019t have to think much about it and just request stuff.\u00a0 With the team globally dispersed, I\u2019d say giving one person the power to do this (on your time) will be the best way going forward.\u00a0 That way you won\u2019t have to wait on us.\nI\u2019d eventually like to upload some archive/reference assemblies (old designs of parts currently in service, which won\u2019t change but need to be referenced for dimensions etc) to share with the US/Copenhagen teams. These assemblies have about 50-60 parts and they should be read-only for everyone except myself. What would be the best way to do this?\nWe can create a structure for some legacy stuff, like a container, where you are the only one with the Read/Write access, and therest of folks have Read-Only access.\u00a0 Another way is to create a Library for global reference , and that way we can add other things like formats, etc.\nHow does your team handle the \u2018tenting\u2019 requirements for sensitive project designs given visibility of the files?\nFor us, we use CPMT tool, which is a centralized tool for our Surface and Xbox folks.\u00a0 HoloLens, and Cloud teams don\u2019t use it.\u00a0 I think that tool is going through a journey of being updated to something that will be called CAMP.\u00a0 If you have another way of tenting, I\u2019d love to hear about it, and we can have your own process in place.\nCould you please delete the CIRCCO part I uploaded during our meeting?\nYou got it!\u00a0 Deleted\ud83d\ude0aI see you have 3 new objects in there!\u00a0 Way to go and test this out!!\nThe system is working wonderfully for me, there\u2019s practically zero lag so far. It would be great to test how it works with two users - would we be able to please set Marijn Lucas up with access so he and I can see what it\u2019s like collaborating through Windchill? I can probably help him get set up if you create an account for him.\nI just set Marjin up in Windchill and you can walk him through the Workgroup Manager setup (he doesn\u2019t need to set up a PTC account if you can share the latest Workgroup Manager zip with him).\u00a0 His username is marijnlucas and heis password is his Corpnet password\ud83d\ude0a.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see if he remembers his.\nCheers,\nMark \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n Hi Mark,\nAll great questions!!\u00a0 Answers are inbold red\ud83d\ude0a\nLooking forward to more questions and excited to see this come to fruition.\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 3** \n\n Thanks Pavel, I\u2019ll organise to speak with Marijn and then get back to you with any more questions.\nCheers,\nMark \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Forgot to mention \u2013 you are not connected to our Production yet, so we will start checking all the stuff in to Production when you and the team are ready.\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nI\u2019ve tried to get Marijn up and running with Windchill but we ran into a small problem \u2013 when he tried to connect to the server it gave this error message below.

Altium\u2019s website lists Windchill as compatible (seePLM Integration with an Altium 365 Workspace | Altium 365 Technical Documentation), but would be good to know if anyone is already doing this at Microsoft and if there are any limitations.\n2) Would Windchill be able to support basic document control of COMSOL Multiphysics simulation files?\nCheers,\nMark \n\n\n**email: 29** \n\n Hi Mark,\nFirstly, I am very glad to hear that you and the team have decided to move forward with our Windchill solution for managing your CAD data\ud83d\ude0a\nNow, to answer your questions:\nDoes anyone currently use Windchill for controlling electronics/PCB design files eg with Altium? Altium\u2019s website lists Windchill as compatible (seePLM Integration with an Altium 365 Workspace | Altium 365 Technical Documentation), but would be good to know if anyone is already doing this at Microsoft and if there are any limitations.\nWe have not used the Altium PLM Integration, but I\u2019m open to investigating it and working with you to incorporate it.\nWould Windchill be able to support basic document control of COMSOL Multiphysics simulation files?\nIf you mean, can we manage other files aside from CAD, then YES, we can check in any other files into Windchill and store them in there with a lifecycle/History, versioning, etc\u2026\nHope this helps\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 30** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nAfter yesterday\u2019s meeting with Keith it sounds like we finally have the go-ahead to start using Windchill.\nKeith has suggested we use the following structure to organise our CAD files:\nQuantum Org\n---Gemini Tented Projects\n------Project A\n------Project B\n------Project C\n---Sculptor Tented Projects\n------Project D\n------Project E\nFor now, I think it makes sense to control access at the project level, and Marijn and I can be admins for approving access.\nWhat\u2019s the next step for setting this up?\nCheers,\nMark \n\n\n**email: 31** \n\n Hi Mark,\nThanks for the email with the explanation of the structure.\nQuick question:\nCan we use our existing Organization for this, so that we are not creating a separate domain?This will not change access restrictionwe discussed, and it will still be managed by your team.We should control access by group management, and create groups, which can either haveReadorRead/Writeaccess, orno access.We will retain the lifecycle structure and have easier ability for automation down the road.\nLet me know if that makes sense, and if it does, I will:\nCreate proper Products (need names)Put you and Marijn in as Product managers and ME\u2019s for each productIf needed, we will add folks (create accounts, etc\u2026) with appropriate accessSub Folders don\u2019t have access control, but if needed, we can create that structure for you\nThanks,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 32** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nThat makes sense and as far as I understand from Keith and should be fine as long as we maintain access restriction as discussed.\nFrom my end could you please create the following products:\ncQED\nCMOS Integration\nCirculator\nkTWPA Package\nDiplexer\nMiscellaneous\n@Marijn Lucaswill have additional product names (Marijn, please send through your list of products that you would like to store on the PDM).\nCheers,\nMark \n\n\n**email: 33** \n\n Hi Markl,\nThanks for clarifying.\u00a0 Before I make these cabinets ,there will all be separate \u201cproducts\u201d or is this all a part of one common top-level assembly?\u00a0 When I make 6 products, they can be end products and reference each other.\u00a0 If this the idea?\nThanks\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 34** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nThese are all separate projects that are unrelated to each other.

I have talked to Mee Burckhardt and she mentioned it would be best to contact CREO\n help in order to contact the one responsible for managing the material library.\nIf you could point me to the one responsible, or provide me with the instructions on how to add a new material to the CREO library that would be great.\nThanks,\nIsadora \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n Adding PDMLink_Admin for greater visibility.\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 3** \n\n @Craig Jonesare you the one responsible for managing\n the materials library or can you point me to the right person?\nThanks,\nIsadora \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Hello Isadora,\nI\u2019m not sure that we have a dedicated person who is managing the Creo material library at this time.\nIt is probably best to send any questions or requests to PDMLink_Admin (who you have copied here).\nI understand you want to add additional materials. Have you been able to create the MTL files?\nAlso, do you have an idea about how many new MTL files you are looking at? If this is a small number, we should be able to add them easily. If this is a large\n number, we may want to set up a meeting to discuss how we will manage the files (folder structure).\nPlease let us know how we can help.\nRegards,\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hi Craig,\nThanks for the email, our ME team is putting\u00a0together a list, but it is not complete\u00a0yet. We want to add mainly plastics that are not in Creo that we use in controllers and consoles. I can't give you an exact\n number of materials that we want to add.\nOnce I have the list ready I will send it to you so we can discuss it further.\nThanks,\nIsadora \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hi Craig,\nWe probably have ~26 to add (or maybe modify existing ones). Is there a way we can permissionto the folder directory directly so we add/ update the materials ourselves to the CREO library?\nIt might be possible to create a XBOX folder there so we only have access to that folder if there are concerns.\nLet me know your\u00a0thoughts.\nThanks,\nIsadora \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Hi Isadora,\nA special folder sounds reasonable. Our Admin team meets tomorrow morning, and we will discuss this as a topic.\nHave you found the library on your own device? I would think the fastest way to generate new MTL files would be to make copies of existing ones. You could begin this at any time. Getting them into the library\n is the easy part.\nWe should have a plan tomorrow.\nTalk soon,\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Hi Craig,\nYes, I have access to the library. I will make a copy of the mtl. and edit as you mentioned. Keep me posted on the discussion tomorrow.\nThanks,\nIsadora \n\n\n",

Creo ParametricIf yout cannot go here, you will need to create a PTC account.\nSCN:2R2494898\nCustomer Number:6390\nWe do not have any support to have an automated download/support for versions aside from what we offer (Creo 7 right now), so you are correct in saying that the Creo 9 data should not be checked into any cabinets in order to not disrupt your engineering community currently using Creo 7.\nAlso, can you please let us know if all the vendors of CHIE are upgrading to Creo 9 or are there other versions?\u00a0 This will help us better decide on our version moving forward.\nThanks\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nHope you had a great week!\nFinally getting around to trying this, can you verify the license server will allow me to use version 9?\u00a0 Note online mentions license file version CS28006 is needed?\nRegards,\nAndy\nAndy Regimbal\nDirector of Infrastructure Architecture\nPrincipal Mechanical/Thermal Architect\nLocation:\u00a0 Austin, TX\nOffice: 737.289.2368 \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Hi Andy,\nThere should be no issue running Creo 9 with our current agreement.@Devices SW Licensesteam to confirm my statement.

Across all Microsoft hardware teams (Surface, XBOX, HoloLens and Azure), there are hundreds of development partners who could be at different Creo versions, and it becomes challenging to have all partners at the same versions. We would like to hear from you about your development model and concerns you will have moving to Creo 10. If those concerns pose challenges in your working model with partners, we can look into Creo 9 upgrade that would be available to your team only.\nPavel,\nCan you set up a meeting with CHIE team to discuss this topic in more detail.\nThanks,\nTejinder \n\n\n**email: 11** \n\n Thanks, Tejinder,\nCouple other questions related to this topic:\nif !supportLists1)endifWhat are the key capabilities of Version 10 vs. Version 9 that users are interested in?\nif !supportLists2)endifGeneral practice in the industry has traditionally been to stay one major rev behind the current available version (9 vs. 10 in this case) for stability/productivity reasons, does Microsoft see this differently?\nif !supportLists3)endifDoes the team have a count of CAD users by organization that can be shared?\u00a0 Would be curious to know which organizations in the Company have the most users.\nLook forward to talking on Friday.\nRegards,\nAndy\nAndy Regimbal\nDirector of Infrastructure Architecture\nPrincipal Mechanical/Thermal Architect\nLocation:\u00a0 Austin, TX\nOffice: 737.289.2368 \n\n\n**email: 12** \n\n Hi Andy,\nTo answer your questions, and possibly expand the conversation:\nif !supportLists1)endifWhat are the key capabilities of Version 10 vs. Version 9 that users are interested in?\nif !supportListsa.endifWe are going to have a Creo 10 session with PTC to ask this question next Monday.\nif !supportListsb.endifWe never considered Creo 9 with the main focus on the latest Creo 10 installation.\nif !supportListsc.endifStudio Engineering team was (and is) using Creo 10 for offline work@Rod Tafareloor@Craig Jonescan elaborate\nif !supportLists2)endifGeneral practice in the industry has traditionally been to stay one major rev behind the current available version (9 vs. 10 in this case) for stability/productivity reasons, does Microsoft see this differently?\nif !supportListsa.endifI agree on this practice, and we can certainly explore Creo 9, but the current path is Creo 10.0.3, given stability test pass and all the documented fixes.\u00a0 Creo11 is releasing in April:\nif !supportListsb.endifThis will put us on a N-1 version, given we are going live by the end of May\nif !supportListsc.endifCreo 10 has been embedded into our ASSIST tool, which installs things by default to our Devices organization, reconfigures our configurations, etc\u2026 Snippet of our ASSIST tool below:\nif !supportLists3)endifDoes the team have a count of CAD users by organization that can be shared?\u00a0 Would be curious to know which organizations in the Company have the most users.\nif !supportListsa.endif@Devices SW Licensesteam should have this information\nif !supportListsb.endifAs far as the purchase order goes:\nif !supportListsi.endifSurface pays for almost half the PTC bill, with CHIE in 2ndplace (not sure if this plays)\nif !supportListsii.endifFrom our tracking, CHIe has 196 internal users, and about 143 external users\nif !supportListsiii.endifAs a comparison, Surface has 458 *mainly internal* users (we don\u2019t track external)\nIf you would like to participate in the Creo 10 presentation on Monday, I can add you to the meeting.\nThanks,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 13** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nThanks for the additional information.\u00a0 Please forward the meeting on Monday, I\u2019ll participate, if possible.\nRegards,\nAndy\nAndy Regimbal\nDirector of Infrastructure Architecture\nPrincipal Mechanical/Thermal Architect\nLocation:\u00a0 Austin, TX\nOffice: 737.289.2368 \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

The ME Xbox team is currently working on updating the Xbox Sensor CAD Standards Library.\nThere are many files and formats in this cabinet that are not in use for the current programs but they are still used and referenced on previous programs.\nDo you know if\u00a0 move all these folders (keeping the same folder structure) to a main folder called \"Previous/Legacy programs templates\" would we still keep them referenced ?\nOr perhaps just rename the folders and keep them in the current location is the best option to maintain the reference on previous programs?\nThanks,\nIsadora \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n Adding@PDMLINK_ADMINfor broader visibility\u2026\nHi Isadora,\nThis is a good question and a right strategy to move forward with the clean library and referential practices.\nMoving legacy objects to a new/existing legacy folder would not break anything.\u00a0 We will just need to know what exact files to move.Renaming folders is also fine, and if this is easier, can be done right away.\nPlease let us know how to proceed and we will make this change quickly\ud83d\ude0a\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 3** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nThanks for the reply, that is great to know.

Both have moved on to other roles, but Mee is still here at Microsoft.\nThese are simple text files, and we have a lot of them.\nI would recommend reaching out to Mee Burkhardt for guidance on adding additional material files.\nI hope this helps,\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hi,\nThanks for the reply.\u00a0 Mee was the initial person I have reached\u00a0out to and she told me to reach out to Creo Help.@Pavel Glukhovif I send you a list of the materials we want to add can you add it? or would I be able to get permission to\n add the materials?\nAlso do we have a specific format we have to delivered the files to you or it can be just a excel with the specs?@Craig Jonescan you send me an example file?\nThanks,\nIsadora \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Hi Isadora,\nI can certainly help with the upload of the files or have you do it with proper access, as long a sI know the location of the library\ud83d\ude0a\nThanks,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Regarding format: Pavel and I are not super knowledgeable about these files.

The material library is also updated automatically when a person restarts Windows.\nThe location of the Material files is:\nC:\\Users\\your_alias\\configs\\MS\\cache\\proe.zip\\materials\\MS_MATERIAL_LIBRARY\nPlease take a look in there. Although these files have a \u201c.MTL\u201d file extension, they are simple text files that can be edited using Notepad or Wordpad. See if you find a material that suits your needs, and\n if not, please grab a copy of one of the text files and modify it. If you can deliver the updated MTL file, we can\u00a0 put it into the library.\nRegards,\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 10** \n\n Hi\u00a0Craig,\nThanks this is great, I will work with the ME team to put a list together including the parameters on the file you send.

We have created the requested cabinet H7021 with Jason as the approver for all future access request.\nDo let us know the team members to be added to Guest and ME roles, respectively.

Please grant access to the following engineers from Ingrays to theH7022folder.\nTo confirm about the guest and ME roles: Guests would be able to view files, and ME role (from Ingrasys) would be able to check-in/checkout and modify the files, correct?\nTitle\nName\nEmail\nMEPM Leader (Guest)\nMark\n\nMEPM\u00a0(Guest)\nPeter\n\nME Engineer Leader (ME)\nRock\n\nME Engineer\u00a0(ME)\nJames\n\nME Engineer (ME)\nVicky\n\nThanks.\nNehal \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hello Nehal,\nYou are right about Access type Guest (Read Only) and ME (Read-Write).

Do we need to request for access for folks from Microsoft? A lot of engineers from Microsoft will need to have access to these folders since this the rack assembly will be shared with other programs. I thought all project folders in Windchill are visible to all Azure employees. I have never had to request access for Microsoft employees.\nThanks.\nNehal \n\n\n**email: 10** \n\n Hello Nehal,\nSure, Added CHIE-ME and CHIE-Guest to ME and Guest role respectively.\nThese groups have CHIE engineers from Microsoft.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh. \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

I hope this is the right place to ask this, but I need some guidance on how to get access to CREO software. I'm collaborating with two people in the GDCO Learning and Development team on a project that involves converting some CAD files for hardware into a format that can be displayed on the HoloLens. The problem is that I can't open or edit *.x_t and .ASM.zip files.\nI tried to work with two colleagues who have CREO, but we faced some difficulties, and I don't want to bother them anymore, so I decided to get CREO myself and handle the files directly.\nI would appreciate any help on how to request access to CREO.

    "email_content": "**email: 1** \n\n PDMLink team,\nI discussed this with Pavel earlier today, and I am following up here in email.\nFirst, some background:\nGoing forward, for all RDM products, we will have 3 PDMLink cabinets. In this example, I will use the made-up CAD Code of CJ67.\nCJ67 (mainline cabinet)\nThis will contain the POR ID CAD for the product.\nCJ67-FE (Front End)\nThis cabinet will be provided for our internal ME teams to develop their CAD models. To build their models, they will need to reference ID CAD from the mainline cabinet, so these cabinets will be cross-linked in 1 direction.\nCJ67-MP\nThis will be where the ODM vendor CAD goes when the project is completed.\nWe will not have multiple CAD codes used for any product.\nNow, for Venezia, we need to make some changes:\nVenezia currently has 2 CAD codes associated with it \u2013 DB11 and EN10.\nWe are going to retire the EN10 cabinet. This should be taken out of circulation in whatever way we can, probably by removing users.\nThe current DB11 cabinet contains both ID CAD and ME CAD.These contents will need to be segregated into 2 cabinets. I believe the easiest path for this is to move all of the ID CAD to a new cabinet that will be called DB11 and rename the current cabinet to DB11-FE.This is simpler than moving all of the ME CAD to a new home.\nI have spoken with Rod and he is currently looking into this. I just wanted to get everyone onboard with the direction we are going. The Venezia ME team is aware of this upcoming change.\nThank you!\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n Adding Rod (sorry). \n\n\n**email: 3** \n\n All,\nI have heard from Mark that he will not be ready to check in his files until later this evening. Let\u2019s plan to move files to the new folder early tomorrow. I plan to be in the office tomorrow, so we can sync then.\nThank you for all the help on this today. I feel like we have a good plan.\nRegards,\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Ho Craig\nWe are on standby for this. Products are ready. Just need to know what data to move once Mark is ready. Talk tomorrow\ud83d\ude01\nThank you,\nPavel Glukhov \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Just to update the thread. I worked with Mark and we moved 82 objects from DB11-FE (old DB11 container) to DB11 (new container).\u00a0 Please validate that everything is good.\nEveryone, who had access to DB11 before, has Guest (Read) access to the new DB11 cabinet, and trtaind the same level of access in DB11-FE.\u00a0 Studio Engineers are all good and set in the new cabinet as well\ud83d\ude0a\nHave a great night!\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Venezia Dev team,\nIt looks like the PDMLink changes we discussed yesterday have been accomplished (see below).\nPlease take a look at your CAD data today to ensure that everything is functioning as it should. I don\u2019t recall us ever renaming a Product Cabinet while it is populated and in-work, so there may be a few surprises. It would be good to find those surprises (if there are any) early today, rather than over the weekend.\nHappy Friday!!!\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Hello Craig,\nCan you please help add Aseem and me approvers for ID cabinet for DB11?\nThank you,\nRohit \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Forwarding to PDMLink_Admin.\nPlease add Aseem and Rohit as approvers for DB11.\nThank you,\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 9** \n\n For clarity: Aseem Singla \u2013 copied.\nThank you!\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 10** \n\n Hello Craig,\nJust to reconfirm, we currently have Ketan Shah/ David Allaway/ Asa Berg / Andy Thompson as Approver/owners of the cabinet.\nDo you suggest replacing the detail or adding Rohit and Aseem as Approvers ?\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh\nPDMLink Admin \n\n\n**email: 11** \n\n Hello Priyanka,\nI would request you to wait for Craigs confirmation on your questions. Below is our discussion and arrangement for this program.\nDB11 is the program where we midway changed how we manage front end and ID work with external ODM partner.Going forward we will create 2 cabinets from get go with different access control.Since we are midway creating the cabinet structure, below is recommendation(Craig to confirm).Move all existing approvers and engineers from DB11 folder to Guest access.Aseem and Rohit will have engineer and approver accessDrafting team members if will continue with Engineer accessStudio engineering members continue to have current access .\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\nThank you,\nRohit \n\n\n**email: 12** \n\n Hello Priyanka, Rohit and Aseem. Happy New Year!\nI agree with what Rohit has described below. It is a bit confusing in this case because we changed things in the middle of the program.\nDB11 is where the Studio Engineers will do their work, so they will need MCAD access to this cabinet. Rohit and Aseem should be the only approvers. The ME team should have Guest access. Drafters should have ME access here also.\nDB11-FE is where the Mechanical Engineers will do their work. Ketan Shah/ David Allaway/ Asa Berg / Andy Thompson should be the approvers for this cabinet, and the ME team should have ME access.\nWe will discuss this further at our team meeting on Thursday, as this will be the template for all future RDM projects.\nRegards,\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 13** \n\n Hey Craig,\nFollowing up on this.\nI am able to access the DB11 cabinet but it is empty at the moment. Is there a timeline on when we will have the DB11 master copied over? I need to kick off the 2D drawings for Venezia soon as ASR is coming up in few weeks.\nThanks!\nAseem Singla \n\n\n**email: 14** \n\n Adding Mark Poling to help answer this. I thought that the Venezia ID model was already in DB11.\nThank you,\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 15** \n\n Hey Aseem,\nThe old DB11 was renamed to DB11-FE.The ID master was moved from DB11-FE to a new DB11.DB11-FE still has the ME files that are referencing the ID master in DB11.\nAdding PDMLinkAdmin.\u00a0 I'm not sure why you're not seeing the ID master in DB11.\u00a0 Looks like it's there when I check.\u00a0 Maybe PDMLinkAdmin can help?\nThanks,\nMark Poling\nSurface Devices | Mechanical Engineer | Cell 321.946.7836 \n\n\n**email: 16** \n\n Hi Aseem,\nYou do have access to DB11-FE (Read/Write) and full Approver access in DB11 (ID) container.\u00a0 You shouldn\u2019t have any issues pulling up any CAD, but if you still do, please get with me and@Rod Tafareloand we will troubleshoot.\nThanks,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 17** \n\n Hi,\nI checked this on my Book device and I can see content in the DB11 cabinet on that.

We have only granted the ownership of theSCE DES Windchill Application PROD - Microsoft AzureApp registration in the Microsoft tenant so that going forward you can easily manage the application from your side whenever it requires any new App URL updates etc.\nFurther, as evident from the below text encircled in orange, action is required only to continue allowing external guest users access to the Application. And as I highlighted previously that since Windchill Application is registered only for Microsoft AAD users and requires VPN connection because it is hosted on the Intranet, thus you may disregard this email as Windchill system has no such requirement to enable guest users access for any of the Non-Microsoft users. I hope this clarifies your concern.\nRegards,\nRaj \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

Ideally, I think this would be a complete copy of an existing program. I\u2019ve been doing some smaller test cases with parts I\u2019ve saved and then created a new small assembly for, but I think it would help to see what obstacles we might encounter if we were dealing with a full CAD assembly that\u2019s already set up.\nThe parts I had been using were from MV60, so that would be my preference for program.\nLet me know if this is something that is possible.\nThanks,\nRebecca \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n Hello Rebecca\nGood Day\nGreat exploration and Thank You for reaching us.\nWould you consider using an existing test Cabinet in Production environment -PDMLink_Trainingwhich is normally the place where all the explorations take place.

I think the main requirement is that it needs to be fairly representative of the cabinet for an actual product in terms of structure and parts/assemblies. And I\u2019d also want to not be able to break anything.\nLet me know your thoughts, or feel free to ping me if it\u2019s easier to have a conversation.\nThanks,\nRebecca \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Thank You for your time Rebecca\nPlease refer the name of folder created for exploration3DCS Exploration.This now have access to the list of people as we discussed.\nEnjoy rest of your day\nRavi A \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hi all,\nRod is helping to copy the MV60 database to the 3DCS Exploration folder below.

Can one of you help?\nThanks,\nRebecca \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hi Rebecca\nJust to be clear, Rod does have sufficient access to PDMLink_Training folder and will be able to see the 3DCS Exploration folder.\u00a0 If we\u2019re talking about granting access to MV60, Rod has Guest access to that folder and if that needs to be elevated, we can go down that route with the approval request.\u00a0 We can also work together to copy objects from one container to another if needed, to simplify the process\ud83d\ude0a\nThanks\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

We had to prioritize software reviews for the factory bringup last month, so appreciate your patience as its been 60 days since you opened the request.\nHere are just some of the issues we are working with(main ones, looking for help with):\nWe originally tried to install a copy from the vendor website, and was unable to get it to work because of licensing issues.Discussions with some of the internal team-they pointed out to Usha that some of the problems could be avoided by using an internal version. Evaluated the internal version of Creo 7.0 and it has a dependency on being connected to Corpnet and also is version 7.0.2.0, which has a remote code execution vulnerability that allows a malicious actor to control the local host without user interaction. Due to the network configuration for Wilmington laptops this would be a risk I\u2019d like to avoid.\nRequest from you to move forward:\nOption A: Can you setup a trial version of Creo later than 7.0.8.0, 8.0.4.0, 9.0.0.0 on a Corpnet device(either your laptop or some other VM) so we can have you get the packet captures for us and we can review them or\nOption B: Reverse engineer the scripts that install the internal Corpnet version of Creo (a version later than 7.0.8.0, 8.0.4.0, 9.0.0.0) and package the installer for us so it can be installed from a file share?(this is going to be a heavy lift)\nCaleb Aguiar | Program Manager 2\nMixed Reality | Security\nOne Microsoft Way | Redmond, WA 98052\nInformation in this mail constitutes trade secrets and commercial or financial information of Microsoft Corporation that is privileged or confidential and is exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 USC 552(b)(4) and Section 5.2d of DoDM 5400.07.

Clicking the \u201cShow Settings\u201d link next to it will bring up the options box.\nThe radio button for \u201cShow hidden files or folders\u201d will need to be changed to \u201cOn\u201d.\nThat will allow any hidden files and folders to be displayed in file explorer.\nThanks,\nJeff \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Jeff,\nNeed your help again.

I notice I am missing access to QE10-MP, and I have not been granted access to the following finished projects:Denali, Torrance, or Arcata. Can you also notify me of the windchill cabinets for the past three products in case I do have access, but am missing the Windchill cabinet number?\nHave a good weekend!\nThanks,\nJacob \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n Hello Jacob,\nAccess to specific cabinets depends on Approval from cabinet owners.

You will receive notification of approval/denial via Teams Activity and an Outlook item.\nLet us know if you have any questions.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh\nPDMLink Admin \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hello Priyanka,\nI have been trying to request access to HK56, (I am tented for it), and it is not going on the typical screen as shown below as I think the BOT app got rebranded into the DNA app, and I am unable to find the Devices BOT in Teams Apps:\nThanks,\nJacob \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hello Jacob,\nYou are right, BOT has been migrated to DNA yesterday.

Yes, we create the parts that cannot be created via Windchill, however the request to create those parts has to be submitted to DCM before those parts are listed in Drawings or shared by the Factory so that the MSPN actually exists before being referenced anywhere. Unless if a request to create a new MSPN/dash-roll has been submitted to us, we have no way of knowing that a new dash roll is needed, the request would also include the details needed to create those parts that we may not have like AML, description etc. Document number H09628 orthis linkshared before is what can be used to request new parts and dash numbers that cannot go through Windchill.\nM1278009-004\nFPCA+MECH,WLC-EFANG+BLM TOP FLEX ASSEMBLY,KABINI, EV3, UMT\nM1291928-002\nMASSY,BLACK,PCBA,GLASS\nM1291931-002\nTPAD,HAPTIC,BLACK\nM1291931-003\nTPAD,HAPTIC,BLACK\nThanks,\nFarirai \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Hi Farirai,\nThanks for the clear explanation and apologies for the confusion.

We recommend going to Object detail page and then select Action\u00e0New\u00e0New Promotion requestion.\nUsing Action from Search table sometime gives issue with missing default value.\nSelecting the option should pop-up a new window with default populated attribute value.\nAnd on next page, you use add + icon or Collect Object icon to add dependent objects in the same PR.\nDo let us know if this helps.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh\nPDMLink Admin \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hi Priyanka,\nI\u2019ve tried creating the PR from the Object detail page but still run into the same issue. I also don\u2019t see the default attribute pop up in the attribute window. And quick question, shouldn\u2019t we be setting both the assembly and drawing to promotion together? But I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve been able to do so with the suggested method of creating new PR from Object detail page since can only choose either the assembly or drawing object to create the PR.\nAny other suggestions on what I can try to do to create PR?\nThanks,\nWinnie \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hi,\nQuick update, I was able to create the PR using the online version of Creo that PDMLink admins sent me for a different Creo issue I had beforeProduct - PS90 (microsoft.com).\nIs there anything I can do to update my Creo settings so that I would be able to create PR on my desktop Creo app instead of having to use the web version every time for PR requests?\nThanks,\nWinnie \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Thanks, Winnie, for updating us. As I understand you accessed Windchill in a standalone edge/chrome browser and PR worked just fine. This confirm you Windchill account or access is working as expected. You are right, PR creation for you should work from Creo as it works for everyone else, and this is a issue.\nWe can investigate this and share our findings soon.\nOn your other question that assembly or drawing object should be selected together to create PR, this can work from the \u201ccommon space folder\u201dActionsbut never from a search table or Creo workspace.\nWe still recommend creating it from object detail page and then using \u201cCollect Objects\u201d gives you all dependent to select and add in the same PR.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh\nPDMLink Admin \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

    "email_content": "**email: 1** \n\n Hi PDMLink team,\nAndrew and I caught an issue that my teammates are also running into with the promote to OnePDM process. We are seeing extra coordinate systems, planes, etc. in the PDFs via the Promote to OnePDM tool compared to our traditional drawing package technique. The only workaround we\u2019ve found is to go into every view in every drawing and hide layers that we normally wouldn\u2019t have to do. This extra step is very time consuming, especially if we want to show some axis or planes but not all.\nIs there a different work around than hiding layers we can use or a fix that can happen with the Promote to OnePDM tool to avoid the extra time needed to prevent these features?\nThank you!\n-Nathan\nTraditional save-as PDF technique we used to create drawing packages \u2013 no coordinate systems shown in the PDF\nPromote to PDM tool to create drawing packages - all of the coordinate systems are shown in every view in the PDF \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n Hello Nathan\nGood Day\nThank You for sharing snapshots.\nWithin Creo drawing please make sure to have the option to show graphically the actual layer status.\nEven when the layers are not hidden, the graphical display filters can hide display. This is only going to impact the PDF that is generated. For example, please look at the example :\nLayers are unhidden , but the drawing view shows no layers. This is not recommended.\nIf the display status is turned on. All the layers will appear.\nIt is recommended to have the layers status adjusted as needed to reflect the content on PDF accordingly.\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nScenario 3\nLayer status\nUnhide\nUnhide\nHide\nGraphic Display status\nUnhide\nHide\nHide\nResultant output \u2013 on PDF as generated by system\nDisplay all layers in PDF\nDisplay all layers in PDF\nNo layers appear in PDF\nIf you need any further assistance, please let us know, glad to assit.\nThank You\nRavi A \n\n\n**email: 3** \n\n Thank you for the reply Ravi!\nWe have been using that technique and an issue we\u2019ll still run into is that sometimes the layer hiding technique will not work. Below is a screenshot where some planes are still showing up after hiding the layers in the 2D. To resolve these isolated incidents we need to track down which part is causing this issue and hide those features in the 3D. This ends up consuming too much time for the MEs given how many drawings we need to push.\nIf there is a way to update the promote to PDM tool in the future so we do not need to hide layers that would be a big win for the MEs as we didn\u2019t have to go through those steps before switching to the promote to PDM tool. It currently consumes a lot of time since we are going back and adjusting layers for many drawings showing these issues.\n@Andrew, for now we\u2019ll use the promote to PDM tool but drawings will have a few extra features like what you caught with the TDM drawing. For any drawings that are extremely severe the MEs will try to take the time to clean them up.\nThanks!\n-Nathan\nPlanes still showing up after hiding all layers in the 2D. The only way we found to resolve this was to go to individual 3D parts and hiding those planes.\nThanks!\n-Nathan \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Hi Ravi,\nI\u2019m also getting empty value errors for some drawings. Any ideas what causes the empty value error preventing promoting these to OnePDM? The top level 3D is a native Creo assembly but it contains several parts that originated from a stp file from the supplier.\nThanks!\n-Nathan \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Sorry for the email spam Ravi \u2013 a teammate pointed me to the \u00a0UpdateSimpRepParam tool but I keep getting a fatal error and Creo crash when I try.\n@Andrew\u2013 I\u2019m probably going to have to do the old fashioned way for some of these release packages. I\u2019ll reach out to you to coordinate.\nThanks!\n-Nathan \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hello Nathan\nGood Day\nNo Problem at all. Thank You for reaching out with snapshot.\nCould you please \u201crefresh configurations\u201d from Assist tool.\nClose all Creo active sessionsEnsure to be MSFT VPN connectedLaunch AssistRun refresh configurationsLaunch CreoCreate a new workspace and add drawings to this.and attempt to \u201cupdateSimpRepParam\u201d action from the ME Productivity Tools\nPlease let us know if this resolves the issue. We can get on a teams call as needed to resolve this quickly.\nThank You\nRavi A \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Thanks Ravi!\nAfter following those steps I still get a fatal error on a couple assemblies but not a huge deal. Andrew and I have a workaround for the small number of drawings that are giving me issues and I\u2019ll use the promotion tool for everything else. I should be good to go for now and thanks so much for taking the time with the troubleshooting advice!\n-Nathan \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

    "email_content": "**email: 1** \n\n Hi David and Jason,\nHope you had a good holiday.\nDuring our conversations related to thermals, we have been assuming that we need to deliver 40C liquid at a flow rate of 1.5lpm/kW for both the GPU and the NVLink switch.\nI wanted to reach out and confirm that, if we wanted to have a slightly higher fluid delivery temperature but were able to deliver it at a higher flow rate, that would meet the cooling requirements, as well?\nFor example, if we hold the cold plate exit temperature constant and increase the inlet temperature and flow rate as shown in the chart below, would that meet the cooling requirements?\nThe above is based on a 5.2kW module power and 49.8C fluid exit temperature.\nLast week, the team mentioned that we might be able to increase the fluid inlet temperature for the GPU from 40C to 45C, can you let us know what the confidence level in that statement is?\nAlso, the team mentioned that the NVLink Switch team was thinking they will still need 40C liquid at 1.5lpm/kW.\u00a0 Can you confirm this?\u00a0 And also, will you continue to try and work to have the NVLink switch requirements the same as the GPU requirements?\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information from my side.\nRegards,\nAndy\nAndy Regimbal\nCHIE - Advanced Platform Architecture (APA)\nAPA Infrastructure/Power/Thermal/Mechanical Lead\nPrincipal Mechanical Architect\nLocation:\u00a0 Austin, TX\nOffice: 737.289.2368\n \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n External email: Use caution opening links or attachments\nHi David and Team,\nWould appreciate it if you could take a few minutes and provide your feedback on this request.\u00a0 We are having internal discussions where you input would be very helpful.\nRegards,\nAndy\nAndy Regimbal\nAPA Infrastructure/Power/Thermal/Mechanical Lead\nPrincipal Mechanical Architect\nLocation:\u00a0 Austin, TX\nOffice: 737.289.2368 \n\n\n**email: 3** \n\n Hi Andy,\nSorry for the delayed response. At this time the 40C liquid temperature is set based on thermal limitations of the XDR OSFPs in the switch tray for the NVlink scaleout config. 45C liquid works for the non-scaleout switch tray. We do not anticipate being thermally limited by the GPU or CPU with either of these boundary conditions.\nI've added Javier to help follow up on the particular details of the thermal benefit at higher flow rates.\nA consideration is that we have been planning to size everything based on staying below 1.5m/s at the 1.5lpm/kW target. This velocity number comes from the Ashrea guidelines around erosion (which I have questions about but it needs further study).\nLet me know if you would like to have a brief call on Thursday or Friday this week to discuss further.\nDavid \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n External email: Use caution opening links or attachments\nHi David,\nThanks for the additional information, much appreciated.\nSo, to confirm, in our non-NVLink scale out system, we should be OK at 45C water at 1.5lpm/kW for both the GPU module and the NVLink Switch module, correct?\nIf we are able to deliver the 40C water at 1.5lpm/kW could we see better performance than with the 45C/1.5lpm/kW?\nLook forward to hearing from Javier regarding the other question below.\nUnderstand regarding the fluid velocity, we\u2019ll keep that in mind.\nRegards,\nAndy\nAndy Regimbal\nAPA Infrastructure/Power/Thermal/Mechanical Lead\nPrincipal Mechanical Architect\nLocation:\u00a0 Austin, TX\nOffice: 737.289.2368 \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n External email: Use caution opening links or attachments\nDavid,\nThe erosion you mentioned at >1.5m/s refers to cavitations corrosion? Or something else?\nFor the cold plate, increase of flow rate will increase pressure drop (assuming no change on cold plate). Could you please provide P-Q curve for cold plate? Like a heat sink, cold plate thermal resistance vs. flow rate is also appreciated in the system design. \u00a0With these two curves it could be a lot more flexible for us to integrate your cold plate in our systems.\nThank you,\nSteve \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Merging threads\n>>The erosion you mentioned at >1.5m/s refers to cavitations corrosion?\nFrom the Ashrea liquid cooling guidelines for datacom equipment centers 2ndEd:\n\"The velocity of the water in the rack\u2019s liquid cooling loop piping must be\ncontrolled to ensure that mechanical integrity is maintained over the life of the\nsystem. Velocities that are too high can lead to erosion, vibration, and water hammer.\nLower velocities lead to lower pressure drop and lower pumping power required to\ntransport the liquid. Table 6.1 provides guidance on maximum chilled-water piping\nvelocities. Any flexible tubing should be maintained below 5 ft/s (1.5 m/s).\"\n>>For the cold plate, increase of flow rate will increase pressure drop (assuming no change on cold plate).

Unfortunately I\u2019m still seeing the same error when trying to open this file, so it might be something on top of the access issue. Initially a popup comes up saying that \u201cModel EE_ZPH\u2026 is not in this directory\u201d, and then the file stops opening and the errors in the screenshot below show up. I haven\u2019t seen this happen before, and I\u2019m not having any luck finding the part file that\u2019s missing, so I\u2019m not sure what the next step could be.\nTheunis \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hello Theunis,\nThe part you are trying to open is from another Product \u2013 Zephyrus where you have no access. It\u2019s normal to have an Assembly which have dependent parts on other cabinets.\nYou need to have at least read access on the dependent products to be able to open assembly correctly.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh\nPDMLink Admin \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Hi Priyanka,\nWould I typically need read access to the dependencies before being able to open the assembly at all? Or would that part just show an error while the rest of the assembly loads as per usual? (In my current case I can\u2019t open the drawing at all) I would like to avoid having to get tented for a completely separate program just to update a number on the drawing, but if that\u2019s the only option please let me know.\nTheunis \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Hi Priyanka,\nI\u2019m unable to find Zephyrus in CPMT to request access, do you know if it\u2019s called something else (maybe Zephyr?) in CPMT?\nTheunis \n\n\n**email: 9** \n\n Hello Theunis,\n\u201cZephyrus\u201d is the name of the cabinet, it\u2019s NOT a Project name in CPMT.\nIf you need Guest access to it, we will need approval from cabinet owner.\nAdding@Jimfor visibility and approval of Guest access.

If you are indeed needing to still be active in PDMLink, we can reactivate your account.\nAs to what version of Creo Parametric to be on, you would still be able to connect to Windchill 12 with Creo 4 M130, but our most current start parts, and all the rest of CAD at Microsoft, is being done in Creo 7.0.2.0. Chadd, or whomever you are working with at Microsoft, should be able to help advise you, but being on Creo 4 may be problematic when sharing CAD data with Microsoft.\nChadd/Anand\u2013 can I ask that you confirm if it\u2019s appropriate to reactivate Roland\u2019s PDMLink account?

Always the most helpful.\nWe need to run testing on 15 devices \u2013 do you know how many devices can use 1 license? Also, are you able to provide a demo CAD file that the team can upload and use for test ?\nThanks!\nErica \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hello again Erica,\nSorry about my delayed response. I\u2019ve been battling a bug for about a week. The smoke in the air hasn\u2019t helped.\nWe manage Creo license usage by users, not by machines. In order for a single user to fetch more than one license, I think we will need to make an exception.\nPDMLink Admins\u2013 please comment here, as I don\u2019t really know the limitations.\nRegarding a CAD model for testing \u2013 is there anything specific you are looking for? Large model size? One of our recent products? I\u2019m sure we can provide something, but I don\u2019t really know what you are trying to accomplish. A bit more detail would help.\nRegards,\nCraig R Jones\nSenior Manager, Studio Engineering \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hi Craig, got it \u2013 so if we had one test account, we could use it across 7 devices for example? \u00a0For the demo model, we wouldn\u2019t want to use any of our products but something very simple you would build out of one of those books/tutorials. We are testing the time it takes for the application to open, how smoothly it runs during certain simple actions, and then export time basically. \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Hello again,\nI\u2019ll try to clarify: We grant Creo licenses to users, not to machines. That means that a single user could use their Creo license on any number of machines, just not at the same time. If you want to run tests or demos simultaneously on multiple machines, we would either need to have multiple users log in (one per machine) or get an exception that would allow a single user to gain access to more than one Creo license at a time.\nI think either one of these is achievable. If you have multiple users, then all we need to do is grant license access to each. If you want to do this with one user on multiple machines, then we need to do an exception. I hope that makes sense.\nFor the CAD file, I will ask my team to provide an ID database from one of our already-released products. This will be light weight enough to by easily usable, but heavy enough to push the machines a little bit. I should have this for you tomorrow.\nPlease let us know if you will be using a single user, and if that person (you, presumably) will need to run Creo licenses on multiple machines simultaneously. Otherwise, please provide a list of users, or tell us if we will need the exception to allow you to fetch multiple licenses at the same time.\nRegards,\nCraig R Jones\nSenior Manager, Studio Engineering \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Erica,\nHere are links to 2 CAD databases. These are the CAD models for Zeus.\nThe first one is quite large \u2013 maybe larger than you want to deal with (450MB). It is the complete ME database. This database will \u201cpush\u201d your system and expose any shortcomings.\nM1157650-DOC_ME_MAIN_ASSY.ASM.zip\nThe next one is the ID database for the same project \u2013 substantially smaller in size than the first one (26MB).\nQW78_ID_Z_MASTER.ASM.zip\nPlease let me know if the links don\u2019t work for you.\nAlso, in speaking with the team about your functional testing, the subject of Creo benchmarking came up. There is an industry standard Creo benchmark test called OCUS. This script runs through a wide range of activities within Creo, testing all aspects of a machine, and then produces a report. We have run this benchmark test on most of our Surface products, as well as many other computers from Dell, HP, and Boxx. We have run it on Zeus. We would be happy to run this benchmark test on any products that you may be interested in getting \u201crelative Creo performance\u201d data for. Just let us know, and we will jump in.\nRegards,\nCraig \n\n\n**email: 9** \n\n Thank you so much Craig, can you possible share us a dummy file as well? I want to be super careful and sure that any of our products (even if released) don\u2019t get out somehow.\nThanks for all of your help here !! The OCUS benchmark test sounds super comprehensive,@Jag Sandharwould be worth connecting on /checking out to see if we can work into our plans.\nErica \n\n\n**email: 10** \n\n Erica and Jag,\nA simple part is attached, as requested.\nMy team and I are both intrigued (concerned?) about what you are trying to accomplish. If this is to determine if Creo will simply function on Ersa, then opening this part will confirm that. However, this will not tell you how Creo performs on Ersa. For that, you will either need to use a more complex database, such as the Zeus models I sent, or run the OCUS benchmark. We have lots of experience with this benchmark and are eager to help, particularly if the intent is to market Ersa as a CAD-capable machine.\nRegards,\nCraig \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

Or is this what we can do best to get the old version back?\nThanks a lot for the help.\nBest regards,\nKevin \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Hi Kevin,\nI will want an answer from some of our Creo experts, like@Ravi Ayyalasomayajula@Craig Jonesor@Rod Tafarelo, but another thing we may try here is to go back in History in Windchill:\nYou can see it under the object\u2019s History tab:\nSelect it, and it will give you the old version of the object, but I believe if you would check this in over the newest version, it will be C.3\nTeam, please chime in\ud83d\ude0a\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nYes that was exactly what I did and it turned from C.1 to C.2 version.\nAny way to change the version tag back to previous version?\nThank you!\nBest regards,\nKevin \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Thank You@Pavel\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\nHello@Kevin\nGood Day\nSo glad you are able to follow the instructions and obtain desired results.\ud83d\ude0a\nInorder to make an older version as current, you have to check out and check in. This results in the iteration to be bumped; C.2 (with \u00a0data from A.5). There is no recommended best practice of leaving C.1 as it is during this operation, we do not encourage deletion of versions from Windchill.\nFor now, you are at the best possible outcome. Please let us know if you have any questions.\nEnjoy rest of your day\nRavi A \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

After the install completes, it will automatically start the Keyshot application.\nAt that point it will open a small window that asks for the license server.\nEnter:27010@AZDESLIC01and clickOK.\nThe network rendering monitor installer (keyshot_network_rendering_win64_11.1.0.46) is also straightforward, and has similar install options (the defaults are fine). Once you have run through the installation, it will open up the KeyShot 11 Network Configuration, where you will want to select the \u201cMonitor Only\u201d radio button.\nOnce the Monitor is installed, it should open and ask for the KeyShot Network Connection. If not, goto \u201cFile > Connection Settings\u2026\u201d to open up that dialog\nEnter in the following for KS11 host and port:\nHost:azcpurender01\nPort:5999\nNetwork rendering can then be selected from the Render option in KeyShot (Ctrl + P).

We are beginning a project that looks set as an XDM engagement model. The intent is that the supplier will own the 3D CAD and 2D drawings, but it is still strongly preferred that all the CAD assets they create live on our Windchill server so that we can have ME access to the same files without having to export/import files back and forth. I wanted to check with you whether it is feasible to set up a Windchill cabinet that provides ME access to external suppliers. If yes, what would be the software requirements on the supplier side? Just Creo 7 or will they need MSFT-IT managed machines as well?\nMuch thanks,\nNavid Poulad\nDirector of Mechanical Engineering|HoloLens HW \u2013 SVC/260.PE\n1045 La Avenida Street, Mountain View, CA 94043|VOIP: +1-650-693-2508\nInformation in this mail constitutes trade secrets and commercial or financial information of Microsoft Corporation that is privileged or confidential and is exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 USC 552(b)(4) and Section 5.2d of DoDM 5400.07. DISTRIBUTION F. \n\n\n**email: 2** \n\n Hi Navid,\nThanks for the ask.\nOur Windchill system is set up to allow external vendors access to our CAD files, so what we can do is:\nCreate external accounts for the engagement partnersGrant them appropriate access to the CAD you own (can be a new container)Manage their onboarding/offboarding accordingly\nWe do require external vendors to be on the same Creo version as we currently use (Creo 7.0.2) to eliminate issues with compatibility.\nMachines don\u2019t need to be MSFT-managed, unless that is your specific ask.\nIf you\u2019d like to discuss this in greater detail, I am happy to jump on a call at any time\ud83d\ude0a\nBest,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 3** \n\n Thank you, Pavel. That\u2019s perfect \u2013 exactly what I was thinking. Have we ever done anything like that with an Asian supplier? Any latency issues that we should be aware of?\nCheers,\nNavid \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Hi Navid,\nCurrently our CHIE segment works in this model and latency is usually not something we hard about.\u00a0 If latency becomes a problem for us, we have an ability to stand up a remote file server somewhere closer to the region and replicate CAD data to this server.\u00a0 This is a technical overhead, which we eliminated some years ago, since we did not do too much CAD overseas, but we can always bring it back, if needed.\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Got it.

Is there any delay or performance degradation?\nRegards,\nTejinder \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Hello Tejinder\nWe only performed preliminary 1 person ( just me from Redmond office location ) testing. \u00a0Connection was successful on various windows build and various device models.\nWe identified what is the change needed and how to enable this change. There is a very minor development/ configuration \u00a0update needed for the end user testing.\nWe are yet to start our user testing.\nOur plan of action is to integrate this change in the Assist tool testing which would be the delivery mechanism for this change. This would also allow us to make a combined change in one go reducing change fatigue on end users.\nIn the coming few weeks we will observe the connectivity, performance and present our learnings before going live.\nThank You\nRavi A \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hello all,\nI was checking to see if we are good enough to start communications from today onwards to make the change ?\nThanks\nHemanth Gandavarapu | Site Reliability Engineer | DES Services | DES Team | Devices \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hello Hemanth\nGood Day\nThank You for sending this email. We are still in process of aligning and testing the delivery mechanism for users. This would have to wait for few more weeks-2 more at the minimum.\nOnce we are clear on the configuration changes complete, then we would need few users to use this and conform.\nAs we get more data from testing, I will update for the change communications.\nThank You\nRavi A \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n +GVS\nThanks for your time on call Ravi and explaining what all tasks in hand in you have to deal with in the mentioned two weeks.\nThanks\nHemanth Gandavarapu | Site Reliability Engineer | DES Services | DES Team | Devices \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Hello Hemanth , Chris\nWe just learned that the requirement of automating change of server to enable a seamless change for ME teams has not been prioritized.\nTo raise awareness of all the background actions needed for this change :\nWhat is completed:\nSet up \u00a0licenses on a AZ server \u2013 Thanks to@Hemanthand@NagamaniWe have completed identification of the changes needed on a preliminary computer.Compare installation procedure using Creo Management Tool to accommodate changes of server- Thanks to@AbhiSetup changes in Assist to accommodate fresh installation on a computer \u2013 Thanks to@AbhiTest installation procedure , License borrowing and returning, \u00a0Validating instantaneous PTC Status. Thanks to@AbhiValidate and confirm by comparing every file generated from both Creo Management Tool and Assist.\nWhat is remaining per plan :\nif !supportLists1.endifImplement changes in Assist to enable users to have a seamless transition by adjusting the files as if it is a clean install. \u2013This did not get prioritized in current sprint\nif !supportLists2.endifTest changes by Admin team\nif !supportLists3.endifInvite test users and confirm complete functionality.\nif !supportLists4.endifRoll out for changes along with launch of Assist.\nImpact on user experience :\nWithout the seamless transition, each user would have to choose either of the path :Option 1 : manually perform steps needed for change.could take anywhere up to 30 minutes based on the network speed available.This is not completely evaluated for full functionality change.Option 2 : Reinstall Creo \u2013 Automated mechanism available.Could take anywhere up to 50 minutes based on network speed available.\nNext steps:\nSince the above 2 options are user invasive, we as a team must discuss on how to approach this. Hence , please be aware that timelines of this migration will be reassessed after a team discussion.\nPlease feel free to comment , ask for clarification on any of the topic. I a teams call is needed, let me know.\nHave a good evening.\nRavi A \n\n\n**email: 9** \n\n Hi Ravi,\nI am trying to understand a little bit more on how different CREO compared to all other third-party products in the organization. All other third-party SW users were able to change the license server with minimal effort to no effort and we did not listen that , a user need to spend minimum 30 min to change the configuration to point to new license server. \u00a0Is it specific to CREO product or the way we use in Microsoft?\nNote : We were under assumption that, changing in the license server is less than 5 min and one time task to client( end user).\nOption 1 : manually perform steps needed for change.could take anywhere up to 30 minutes based on the network speed available.This is not completely evaluated for full functionality change.\n[GVS] Does license server change warns functional testing ? Are we planning to change anything else in CREO in coupling with License server change ?\nOption 2 : Reinstall Creo \u2013 Automated mechanism available.Could take anywhere up to 50 minutes based on network speed available.\n[GVS] Does License server name change leads to re-install CREO ?\nThanks\nGVS | PRINCIPAL SRE MANAGER| 425 241 9940 | DES Team | Devices\nMy role is enabling Devices Engineering Services team to deliver modern ,usable and\u00a0 flexible engineering solutions to accelerate Product development in Microsoft Devices organization.\nI am available for meetings from 9:30 AM to 4 PM PST \n\n\n**email: 10** \n\n Good Evening GVS\nAn excellent question\ud83d\ude0a.\nI will surely attempt to provide insights and would also add@Craigincase further elaboration is needed.\nPlease pardon my long response in aim of generating clarity. \u00a0I would have preferred to discuss this over team\u2019s call\ud83d\ude0ato make it easy.\nhow different CREO compared to all other third-party products in the organization.\nCreo Parametric is a CAD authoring software that is prominently used by ME teams across all Hardware groups ( Devices, CHIE, MR, X-BOX)\u00a0 in \u00a09 countries with user base of over 400 + unique users.PTC out of the box installation is highly configurable and provides open access during installation process to users. PTC also does not restrict users installing any version of software with same license files.At Microsoft, current process has evolved over time to ensure the following for every user who has need with Creo Parametric.Ensure all users with similar capabilities at same level.Remain in same version of software so there is no compatibility challenge in collaboration and data exchange.Stay in compliance with license utilization.Consistent data authoring : Output of the CAD data has a significant impact on configuration options ( used during authoring, import and export)\nCREO product out of box or the way we use in Microsoft:\nUsing Out of box operation is interactive and does not limit only to point license server. Users will have to go through the process of evaluating entire settings, this introduces a possibility of user error which can then branch out to various unintended scenarios. Our current process has evolved from all these events and stayed true.Current Process specific to Microsoft > Admin controlled action : Through our delivery mechanism \u2013 Creo Management tool or Assist, users would not have to go through any of the interactive mode. Everything is streamlined and delivered in one click.\nTime involved for change of license server :\nYes, this is a one-time setup change but not a 5 min change when done with out of box interactive mode.The variability in time depends on user network speed. \u00a0In general, from past data,for users in Redmond this takes 7 -10 minutes.For users in Fareast , this could be up to 30 minutes.\nDoes license server change warns functional testing.\nEvery change implemented , as a best practice, \u00a0we follow testing before roll out.\nThis change is minor, and testing would need under 10 users across geographies to participate with a window of 2 weeks to respond any loss of functionality.\nThis process would have to work for the following 3 scenarios :\nWith our current journey of identifying the change and development, we have covered :\nA new installation on a computerBorrowing of license\nWhat is remaining \u2013 and also the highest number of users would fit this scenario\nExisting user , repointing the license.\nDoes License server name change leads to re-install CREO ?\nNo.\u00a0 In the best-case scenario, either of the Option 1 or Option 2 is not encouraged because they involve user to pause working and allocate time to accommodate this change as this change with immediate effect will deny license if server is moved.\nHowever, if further development is not an option, these are the only 2 options to make this change effective. Users can choose either of the options.\nPlease feel free to comment , ask for clarification on any of the topic. I would be glad to get on a teams call to explain futher.\nThank You\nRavi A \n\n\n",

Every business group has different Configuration Management Team. From Windchill, this needs to be enabled for the products you are interested. For now, I have \u00a0made the change on S2180. You should see this field prepopulated moving forward.\nPlease let us know which all products would you want us to enable this setting with, to enable MSPN generation\nThank You\nRavi A \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hi Ravi,\nI am not able to bring up the CHIE Cloud Configuration Managers identity as a delegation option.\nI am able to bring up Cloud Config Team. Would this be ok?\nThank you,\n~ Anjanette \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Hello Anjanette\nI am not really aware of this.\n@Priyanka Mathurwould you be able to provide guidance on how to proceed further. Is it okay to delegate this to an individual Configuration Manager, if yes, would you be able to extend help.\nThank You\nRavi A \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n +Aditya & Mani for visibility.\nHi Ravi,\nThe only option to assign the configuration managers that was available in the drop down bar were only 3 people.\nFrom what I recall, it was possible to pull / associate the MSPN from the program that one would be working on and assign the request to configuration managers from ONEPDM team.\nNow there were only 3 names available in the pull down bar. For pulling a new MSPN, I would like to see all the projects with a program folder be accessible to associate the MSPN to the program of choice.\nPlease provide steps to pull MSPN and associate it with programs as needed, and help to making this easier than the current experience.\n@Aditya Raghavendra Auradker, Since the MSPN pulled on Windchill was \u2013 M1288982-001 and description listed as \u201cNon-Removable USB-A plug\u201d, I have updated the 3D & 2D CAD with this MSPN. With all of these hurdles to pull MSPN in Windchill, please pull a MSPN from ONEPDM and@Manikanta Kambampati (HCL TECHNOLOGIESCORPORATE)please help to rename the 3D and 2D part from M1288982-001 to whatever MSPN that is pulled from ONEPDM team and move fast on this.\nAttached onepdm package or reference.\nRegards,\nAashish \n\n\n**email: 9** \n\n +Larry Cannon\nThanks,\nPriyanka \n\n\n**email: 10** \n\n The config team in the drop-down includes all the people that Priyanka works with. The intent is that they\u2019ll figure out among themselves who owns the particular parts/assemblies. Correct, Priyanka?\nLarry Cannon | Sr. Mechanical Engineer |\nCHIE - Cloud Hardware & Infrastructure Eng\n425-538-3761\nPrescott, Arizona \n\n\n**email: 11** \n\n Hi Larry or Priyanka,\nCan you please advise who I should delegate the MCAD Part Review Notification to help close it out?\nThank you,\n~ Anjanette \n\n\n**email: 12** \n\n Not sure what the ask is here. When creating an MSPN in Windchill, this is what you get in the Config Mgr drop-down. There is only one choice.\nLarry Cannon | Sr. Mechanical Engineer |\nCHIE - Cloud Hardware & Infrastructure Eng\n425-538-3761\nPrescott, Arizona \n\n\n**email: 13** \n\n Hi Larry,\nIn OnePDM, we receive a notification with a workflow activity to mark as \u201cReviewed\u201d when adjustments to the MSPN are complete.\nIt would not be correct for me to mark this as \u201cReviewed\u201d, so it would be better to delegate this to the actual reviewer.\ud83d\ude0a\nThank you,\n~ Anjanette \n\n\n**email: 14** \n\n This is on the other side of what we do when we create part numbers, so it\u2019s beyond what we see.\u00a0 Sorry, can\u2019t help.\nLarry Cannon | Sr. Mechanical Engineer |\nCHIE - Cloud Hardware & Infrastructure Eng\n425-538-3761\nPrescott, Arizona \n\n\n**email: 15** \n\n Hi Larry,\nThank you for your response.

Hence there is no designated Configuration Manager field that is pre-populated.\nIn general, Part Numbers are reserved from specific product cabinets where , the value is pre-populated and normally an alias instead of an individual CM.\nSince this is an exception scenario, and number of occurrences are extremely rare, the steps followed during this are the best case action.\nPlease \u00a0help elaborate if I missed to see any other possibility of information, or this explanation helps clarify.\nHave a good day\nRavi A \n\n\n**email: 10** \n\n Ravi,\nJulie, Priyanka and I went into the cabinet and set it up for use with Configuration Management and the OnePDM group in question.\nJulie (as far as we know) was successful in getting what she needed, but do you believe that we should not have this solution live in this cabinet?\u00a0 I think the only thing that the users must be mindful of is the Project Name f OnePDM space, which they will need to select from the drop-down\u2026\nThanks,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 11** \n\n Hello Pavel\nAs you are already aware, Collaborative Design Cabinet is extremely close to a Library (common component), to enable reusability.\nThis Windchill Product caters to multiple cabinets, which necessarily are not of one Product Category, hence mapping to a specific alias (WDS Surface Laptop Configuration Managers)would not meet all the requirements this specific Product is intended to meet with.\nAs a future possibility : In case we have to then we may need a generalized alias from One PDM Configuration Management team \u00a0likeWDS Surface Configuration Managerswhich would be used specifically for shared product cabinets.\nThank You\nRavi A \n\n\n**email: 12** \n\n Hi Ravi & Pavel,\nThank you for your input regarding this matter.\nAdding@Mike Brittain Jr (HE/HIM)to help comment on the future possibility: Should we add a OnePDM alias that would allow for non-product line specific MCAD requests like this example for SSD parts?\nThank you,\n~ Anjanette \n\n\n**email: 13** \n\n I think that is a great idea.\nIf we can use an alias, I suggest the \u201cDCM Managed Services\u201d alias.\nThursday, June 22nd\nDragon Boat Festival 2023\nDuanwu Festival\nHoliday\nThe Dragon Boat Festival is a traditional holiday originating in China, occurring near the summer solstice.

Below is a high-level summary:\nSelect which information is available (CPMT\u00a0nameorPDMLink Product name)Choose the appropriate access level (GuestorME\u00a0/ EngineerorMCAD Engineer)Provide justification (allows approver to understand why access is needed)With appropriate sub-group tenting and if the request is not a duplicate, the BOT App will submit a new request.\nOn completion of PDMLink Approver's deliberation, the PDMLink access request is processed. You will receive notification of approval/denial via Teams Activity and an Outlook item.\nDo let us know if you have any questions.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh\nPDMLink Admin \n\n\n**email: 3** \n\n HiPriyanka,\nWhen using the BOT, Can I submit the request on behalf of Virpi, Eeva-Liisa and Pertti? Or do each of them have to enter their own request in the BOT?\nThanks,\nPatrick \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Hello Patrick,\nYou can do it by selecting \u201cothers\u201d option or individuals can do it for themselves. The process completion depends on cabinet owners Approvals.\nSorry for the late check,I can confirm all three users are already part of Romulus Cabinet in GUEST role. No action needed.\nIf you need any other BOT enabled cabinet access, Please refer the snapshot below for step by step process.\nRegards!\nPriyanka Singh\nPDMLink Admin \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n ThanksPriyanka.

Overwrite the version to bring Rev J data to Rev K is the way to go.\nPlease\u00a0 follow the attached document, which lists step by step process of how to achieve this.

I can now access my team\u2019s cabinet, but Creo crashes whenever I try to access a product assembly.

The toaster method did help somewhat. Creo doesn\u2019t crash anymore once the assembly is loaded. However, it is still extremely slow to respond to commands and will buffer for a while between commands.\n Is there anything else I can do to improve the lag?\nThank you,\nMirela \n\n\n**email: 7** \n\n Hi all,\nI am following up on this. My Creo continues to be very slow and laggy. It is slow to respond to commands and the screen frame rate is much slower than what my coworkers experience on their devices. The performance improves slightly when\n I connected to my dock at my office in Redmond, but otherwise when the device is on its own, it is very difficult to do my work.\nIs there anything else that can be done to improve the speed of Creo?\nThank you,\nMirela \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Hi Mirela,\nWE should have a call to investigate what you\u2019re seeing on your machine to understand how we can better help you be more productive with our tools.\u00a0 Let\u2019s wait on Rod to respond and then jump on a call.\nThanks,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 9** \n\n Hi@Mirela,\nCan you schedule a one-hour meeting so we can go over your computer?\nThanks,\nRod.\nGetOutlook for iOS \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

Let me install Cre View Express from the link provided below. \n\n\n**email: 12** \n\n I think I know what\u2019s going on\u2026since the .prt and .drw files were not generated to create .pvz (special CreoView file format) viewables, CreoView cannot open direct files.\u00a0 Maybe Creo install would be best in this case\u2026\nFor Creo Parametric installation, use the Microsoft Creo Management Tool.The current build we use at Microsoft is Creo 7.0.2\nThe shortcut to install the tool is locatedhere(go to the link, right-click the shortcut andrun it as administrator).This requires aVPN Connection, unless you are hardwired in a corpnet locationAfter the Microsoft Creo Management Tool has been installed, launch the tool (it will show up in your programs menu) and choose \u201cInstall\u201d for Creo Parametric (and Creo Simulate if you are a Simulate user)\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Please refer the attachaed images which are the attachments to the above email chain",

Due to the latest tight schedule concern, we\u2019d like to confirm whether Benham will have pre-build or not.\n You are right.\u00a0 Based on my understanding, there is no pre-EV build planned for Benham.\n2.If confirm we will directly go to EV1, then there are corresponded questions for EV1 DK timeline. Based on the latest schedule we received, EV1 SMT build will happen on 11/18; assuming\n we need to prepare some DKs in FA room for FAI and MTE bring up, material should dock by 11/4, then we need to receive the dwg no later than8/16for both PCBA and device cad to catch to EV1 build. Please advise when we will have preliminary 3D cad for study?\n Yes, understand that the PCBA lock schedule impacts SMT build.\u00a0 Our current target PCBA lock is 8/27.\u00a0 I recognize this\n is after the date you have specified above, the team is trying to see what we can do to still maintain the EV1 schedule given the current design lock dates. \u00a0\u00a0Appreciate your collaboration.\u00a0 I will check with the team regarding preliminary 3D CAD.\nDK schedule-\nProcess\nL/T\nDate\nRemark\nME Design Lock(layout placement)\n8/16\nNecessary:\n1.

The main contact window for ME RD will be Steven, and ME PM\n will be me.\nME Lead- Steven Yeh\nME Consultant and Support- Richard Guen\nME local support- Tassadar Gao\nME PM- Laurie Chang\nHere are some Questions:\n1.Following up on the topic from my last email, since we recognized that timeline is constrained and tight after having the weekly meeting with Kore Dev PM for EV1 schedule readiness,\n we\u2019d like to know if it\u2019s possible to getpreliminary 3Danddraft device BOMfirstly to start DK design and DFA review earlier.\n2.So far, we have received ECO ECO-00064427 and ECO-00064780 in succession for creating PCBA BOM, there are 7 ME parts inside which I listed below. Since we didn\u2019t receive 3D\n for BOM comparison, it\u2019ll be helpful if you can help to reply in the column, then after we receive the 3D, we can compare again for the difference.\nFirst 6 parts matched with Ludlow latest MP BOM, please confirm they are same design with Ludlow\u2019s so we can leverage them.We saw in ECO listed M1148183-001 for locating pin, but latest version has changed toM1148183-003in Ludlow MP, which is 0.5 taller then 001. Please check which one we use for Benham and correct BOM.\nECO MSPN\nBOM description\nJDM1 PN\nJDM1 ME comment\nKore\u2019s comment\nM1151609-001\nCONN,CLIP,COAX,VERTICAL,SM,FOR 1.13MM COAX\n13N4-10N1311\nUse in Ludlow MP\nM1153228-001\nINSERT,STEEL,THERMAL,TIN,SM,2.9 OD\n13N4-10N2111\nUse in Ludlow MP\nM1149391-001\nSTDF,M1.2X0.25,STEEL,THREADED,SM,STIFFENER\n13N4-10N1201\nUse in Ludlow MP\nM1176784-001\nSHIELD,FENCE,T3\n13N4-10N0E61\nUse in Ludlow MP\nM1176786-001\nSHIELD,FENCE,T2\n13N4-10N0G51\nUse in Ludlow MP\nM1168203-001\nSHIELD,FENCE,T1\n13N4-10N0D41\nUse in Ludlow MP\nM1148183-001\nPIN,LOCATING,TIN,STEEL,TIN,SM,3.6MM\n13N4-10N0821\nLatest MP PN in Ludlow is-003, please check which one we use for Benham.\nThe difference between 001 and 003 is the height of pin, -001 is 3.6, and -003 is 4.1.\nThanks,\nLaurie \n\n\n**email: 4** \n\n Hey Laurie and the Benham JDM1 team!\nNice to meet you all and looking forward to building Banham together.\nIt\u2019s gonna be fun.\nI will share our team roster and roles and responsibilities soon.\nAs for CAD, we are in the process of building the EV1 design but will be happy to share latest snap shot design.\nThanks!\nEugene \n\n\n**email: 5** \n\n Hi Eugene,\nSure, that would be very helpful, thank you!\nOur team have access to log into sharepoint now, if you have anything new that can share with us, please let me know.\ud83d\ude0a\nThanks,\nLaurie \n\n\n**email: 6** \n\n Hi Eugene, Amy,\nHow have you been?

I put some detail explanation as remark\n for reference.\nJDM1 Question\nFeedback from KORE\nJDM1 Remark\n1\nThe DK material is plastic, and the design concept is like EnH and Ludlow. Is it ok?\nYes, would like to know the material options used on E&H and Ludlow\nDo you have specific material request? if no, we will use plastic material followed ENH and Ludlow program.\n2\nDoes DK need to accommodate for both 13.5\" and 15\" ?\nYes\nPlease check internally if Kore has demand to switch different sizes TDM in Redmond. In previous generation, we normally design the TDM frame to a size\n which can accommodate both 13 and 15 TDM, so Kore can replace different TDMs by yourselves in Redmond.\n3\nNeed three DK FPCs(Keyset, BLM, trackpad) for DK slide keyset same as Ludlow.\n1. Could you please provide each connector data sheet and location on 3D CAD ?\n2. Also need the location of keyset FPC, BL FPC and trackpad on 3D CAD.\noutline lock in progress\nConnector\u2019s data sheet I\u2019ve received from our EEs.\nBut we still need the location for these three connectors(keyset, BLM, trackpad)\n4\nCould you please indicate the location of Dragonfly connector on MB?\nTbd\nSame as above question 3, need to know the location of this connector on MB.\n7\nJDM1 thermal team proposes one off the shelf thermal module.\nUnder studying with the heat sink design leverage from Ludlow.\nNeed to check if Kore has specially demand for thermal DK TDP?\nTbd\nNormally Kore only request the system level thermal TDP but would like to double check this for Benham.\nWhat is the goal for thermal DK TDP?\n8\nOTS Wi-Fi antenna attached on DK or in packing.\nTbd\nPlease check if there\u2019s requirement to design Antenna on DK for test or not?\nLudlow: use extra OTS antenna put on DK.\nDaO/EnH: use device antenna but pack/ship as accessory.\nQuestion for Kore ME team, will wait for@Amy Zhu\u2019s further update.\n3\nNeed three DK FPCs(Keyset, BLM, trackpad) for DK slide keyset same as Ludlow.\n2.

We have checked in the history of MS Part Author identity and per history Priyanka Singh and Vaibhav were never added under this identity prior to 5/8/2023 12:01:21 PM.\nYou were removed from this identity in 2019 and it is not by support. Please find the below screenshot for your reference and let us know if you require any additional information from support end.\nThanks & Regards,\nSandeep Challa \n\n\n**email: 11** \n\n Thanks for the clarification.\u00a0 I have been hands-off from creating MSPN\u2019s since we implemented the automation live, so it makes sense that I don\u2019t have access.\u00a0 Wasn\u2019t aware about Priyanka and Vaibhav not having access.\u00a0 Thanks for clarifying both points and we are aligned.\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 12** \n\n Hi@Pavel Glukhov,\nIN# :\nINC33557191\nApplication:\nONEPDM\nPriority:\n3 \u2013 Normal\nIssue Description:\nPROD MSPN FAILED - ACCESS ISSUE\nCurrent Status:\nClosed\nImpact:\nSingle User\nResolution:\nThanks for the confirmation.

Perhaps my question was not very clear. Let me give an example:\nStep 1. My tenting request to product HK56 has already been approved in CPMT. (This request is completed)\nStep 2. I will provide relevant information (such as project code HK56, access level, justification) to DeviceHelp Bot through a conversation, and DeviceHelp Bot will submit my access request to HK56 in Windchill. As shown in the figure below.\nStep 3. I will receive feedback from theFlowindicating whether my access request has been rejected or approved.\nSo my question is, from Step 2 to Step 3, will DeviceHelp Bot submit my access request to a human(relevant CPM, ME lead\u2026) for judgment on whether to approve it, or will DeviceHelp Bot automatically determine whether to approve it (automation, robot)according to the justification I provided? I am curious about this point.\ud83d\ude0a\nThanks!\nBR\nRalf \n\n\n**email: 8** \n\n Hi Ralf,\nTo simply answer the question, Yes, your request goes to a specific person, who is assigned the Approver role, and they either approve or reject your request.\nThanks,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 9** \n\n Hi Pavel,\nI see!\nRegarding this specific person (who is assigned the Approver role):\nQ1. What is the role of this specific person? Is it also the Confidential Project Manager (CPM) or the ME Leader for the corresponding project?\nQ2. How many specific persons are generally designated for a project? Can applicants see this list? Because the name of this specific person cannot be seen after the Access Request is submitted by DeviceHelp Bot. If there is a delay of several days (for example, 3-5 days) because this specific person missed or forgot about the request, who should the applicant seek assistance from to push forward the approval process?\nThanks!\nBR\nRalf \n\n\n**email: 10** \n\n Hi Ralf,\nIn the case of HK56, the approvers are the same folks, who would approve your CPMT, and who approve access to this specific container when we did it in a manual way.\nUsually we have at least two folks, who can approve access to the container. You can see this by expanding the container in the navigation pane and clicking on Teams sub-menu.\nIf you\u2019re experiencing delays, you can always contact our@PDMLINK_ADMINalias and we will dig into why there is a delay.\nThanks,\nPavel Glukhov\nDDM Product Manager\nMicrosoft\nSurface Devices\nMobile: (360)510-1027\n \n\n\n**email: 11** \n\n Very helpful.
