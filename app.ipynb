Let's go back to the PDM link training product in the browser view.\\n00:37:59 Speaker 1\\nHere's my search remembered, and this is the part that I want. I call this the easy button sometimes, but just to the left of the file name column there is this square within a square icon that says open in Creole. This is a shortcut that you get for every single piece of CAD. This column is the same for all the CAD you'll see. That's a shortcut to do that.\\n00:38:20 Speaker 1\\nOpen in Creole for this part right here. So once you find the part, I'm going to click this now open in Creole with one click. This is in my workspace, and I'm looking at that same CAD.\\n00:38:30 Speaker 1\\nThis is probably the only way that you will be using to open CAD from read only products, so those of you that mentioned you're on the DFX team or you're somewhere where you're not actively developing or modifying CAD that add to or that open and creo button will be how you open CAD and and you can see it's immediately up on your screen.\\n00:38:51 Speaker 1\\nYou could spin it around and analyze it however you want, but that's the most common way to get CAD into your workspace, especially as a read only user.\\n00:38:59 Speaker 1\\nHave I lost you so far?\\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\\nIf so, please ask the question. Otherwise, I really hope everybody's following along and just maybe healthfully bored. OK, so now that I have the cat in my workspace, well, how do I go about modifying it in some way? And then if I'm happy with that modification, check it back in for everybody else to see.\\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\\nSo that requires read write access to the product. In this case I do have read write access to where this part is and so I can modify this part if I want.\\n00:39:30 Speaker 1\\nNow this is not checked out to me right now.

Let's go back to the PDM link training product in the browser view.\\n00:37:59 Speaker 1\\nHere's my search remembered, and this is the part that I want. I call this the easy button sometimes, but just to the left of the file name column there is this square within a square icon that says open in Creole. This is a shortcut that you get for every single piece of CAD. This column is the same for all the CAD you'll see. That's a shortcut to do that.\\n00:38:20 Speaker 1\\nOpen in Creole for this part right here. So once you find the part, I'm going to click this now open in Creole with one click. This is in my workspace, and I'm looking at that same CAD.\\n00:38:30 Speaker 1\\nThis is probably the only way that you will be using to open CAD from read only products, so those of you that mentioned you're on the DFX team or you're somewhere where you're not actively developing or modifying CAD that add to or that open and creo button will be how you open CAD and and you can see it's immediately up on your screen.\\n00:38:51 Speaker 1\\nYou could spin it around and analyze it however you want, but that's the most common way to get CAD into your workspace, especially as a read only user.\\n00:38:59 Speaker 1\\nHave I lost you so far?\\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\\nIf so, please ask the question. Otherwise, I really hope everybody's following along and just maybe healthfully bored. OK, so now that I have the cat in my workspace, well, how do I go about modifying it in some way? And then if I'm happy with that modification, check it back in for everybody else to see.\\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\\nSo that requires read write access to the product. In this case I do have read write access to where this part is and so I can modify this part if I want.\\n00:39:30 Speaker 1\\nNow this is not checked out to me right now.

Doesn't matter if it's read, write or just read. Only this list of products is any product that you have access to and you notice we have over 1000 products in wind chill.

So if I click this product from the name column.\\n00:18:29 Speaker 1\\nI'll go into the CAD from the Surface Pro 3 cabinet from GP79.

I'm just gonna randomly pick one of these parts. I hope I pick one that isn't grabbing a bunch of other stuff, but I'm going to choose open and Creole to this random part from Surface Pro 3. It's going to put a copy in my workspace and then open the copy.\\n00:19:18 Speaker 1\\nAnd as soon as that's done, I'll take you into my workspace to.\\n00:19:20 Speaker 1\\nShow.\\n00:19:20 Speaker 1\",\n",

Let's go back to the PDM link training product in the browser view.\\n00:37:59 Speaker 1\\nHere's my search remembered, and this is the part that I want. I call this the easy button sometimes, but just to the left of the file name column there is this square within a square icon that says open in Creole. This is a shortcut that you get for every single piece of CAD. This column is the same for all the CAD you'll see. That's a shortcut to do that.\\n00:38:20 Speaker 1\\nOpen in Creole for this part right here. So once you find the part, I'm going to click this now open in Creole with one click. This is in my workspace, and I'm looking at that same CAD.\\n00:38:30 Speaker 1\\nThis is probably the only way that you will be using to open CAD from read only products, so those of you that mentioned you're on the DFX team or you're somewhere where you're not actively developing or modifying CAD that add to or that open and creo button will be how you open CAD and and you can see it's immediately up on your screen.\\n00:38:51 Speaker 1\\nYou could spin it around and analyze it however you want, but that's the most common way to get CAD into your workspace, especially as a read only user.\\n00:38:59 Speaker 1\\nHave I lost you so far?\\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\\nIf so, please ask the question. Otherwise, I really hope everybody's following along and just maybe healthfully bored. OK, so now that I have the cat in my workspace, well, how do I go about modifying it in some way? And then if I'm happy with that modification, check it back in for everybody else to see.\\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\\nSo that requires read write access to the product. In this case I do have read write access to where this part is and so I can modify this part if I want.\\n00:39:30 Speaker 1\\nNow this is not checked out to me right now. Remember I said as soon as you start modifying the part.\",\n",

Doesn't matter if it's read, write or just read. Only this list of products is any product that you have access to and you notice we have over 1000 products in wind chill.

I'm just gonna randomly pick one of these parts. I hope I pick one that isn't grabbing a bunch of other stuff, but I'm going to choose open and Creole to this random part from Surface Pro 3. It's going to put a copy in my workspace and then open the copy.\\n00:19:18 Speaker 1\\nAnd as soon as that's done, I'll take you into my workspace to.\\n00:19:20 Speaker 1\\nShow.\\n00:19:20 Speaker 1\",\n",

      "3. Give answer in step by step format.\n",
      "4. Keep your answer concise and solely on the information given in the Context above.\n",
      "5. Always provide the answer with all relevant citations, ensuring that each citation includes the corresponding timestamp and document number used to generate the response. Provide the citation in the following format only at the end of the whole answer not in between.\n",
      "    - For transcript, use: [timestamp, documents number]. for example [['00:11:00', 1], ['00:1:44', 2]]\n",
